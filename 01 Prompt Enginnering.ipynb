    "### Prompt Engineering Guide\n",
    "https://www.promptingguide.ai/\n",
    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "1) LLM Settings\n",
    "    * Temperature - it controls the randomness of the AI model, lower the value more factual & deterministic, higher the value more creative\n",
    "    * Top P - nucleus sampling, lower value selectes the most confident response, higher value selectes more diverse response\n",
    "    * Max Length - manage number of tokens generated, helps to control long, irrelevant response and costs.\n",
    "    * Stop Sequences - Control length and structure of model's response\n",
    "    * Frequency Penalty - reduces the repitition of words in the response, higher the repetition higher the penalty\n",
    "    * Presence Penalty - penalty for repetition irrespective of number of repetition\n",
    "2) Basics of Prompting:\n",
    "    * Provide more context + Provide a prompt format\n",
    "3) Prompt Elements:\n",
    "    * Instruction | Context | Input Data | Output Indicator |\n",
    "4) General Tips for Designing Prompts:\n",
    "    * Start Simple - try breaking a bigger task into simpler sub tasks for the AI in the prompt\n",
    "    * The Instruction - use commands like write, classify, summarize, translate, order, create, etc.\n",
    "    * Specificity - Be very specific about the instruction and task you want the model to perform + Desired Style of the outcome\n",
    "    * Avoid Impreciseness - be precise on what you want the model to perform\n",
    "    * To Do or Not To Do? - avoid saying what not to do but say what to do instead\n",
    "5) Examples:\n",
    "    * Text Summarization | Information Extraction | Q & A | Text Classification | Conversation | Code Generation | Reasoning |\n",
    "#### Prompting Techniques:\n",
    "1) Zero-shot Prompting: original model response\n",
    "2) Few-shot Prompting: response after passing some examples to the model\n",
    "3) Chain-of-Thought Prompting: enabling complex reasoning through a series of intermediate reasoning steps.\n",
    "4) Meta Prompting: Structure-Oriented | Sytax Focused | Abstract Examples | Versatile | Categorical Approach\n",
    "5) Self Consistency: few-shot CoT\n",
    "6) Generated Knowledge Prompting: demostrate knowledge to the model through prompt and integrate the knowledge to its response\n",
    "7) Prompt Chaining: step by step approach of breaking down complex questions to the model\n",
    "8) Tree of Thoughts: combining CoT & Self Consistency --> select best candidate from each intermediate step to move to desired response\n",
    "9) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): provide access to external knowledge sources to complete the task\n",
    "10) Automatic Reasoning & Tool-use (ART): combination of CoT & Tool output\n",
    "11) Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE): using an interface LLM to generate instructions and guide a target LLM to execute it\n",
    "12) Active-Prompt: CoT with human annotations (multiple candidates will be generated in each step)\n",
    "13) Directional Stimulus Prompting: passing hints to guide a LLM\n",
    "14) Program-aided Language Models (PAL): CoT with a programmatic approach such as using a python interpreter\n",
    "15) ReAct Prompting: pass both reasoning trace and task-specific actions to the LLM through prompt\n",
    "16) Reflexion: reinforce through linguistic feedback - Actor | Evaluator | Self-Reflection |\n",
    "17) Multimodal CoT: text + vision \n",
